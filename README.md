# Data Structures and Algorithms in Python for Interview Prep

This repo contains implementations of common data structures (like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs) and algorithms (sorting, searching, dynamic programming, etc.) in Python. Itâ€™s designed to help me review and practice for coding interviews.
